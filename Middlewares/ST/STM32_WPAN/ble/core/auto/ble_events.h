 * indicates if the disconnection was successful or not. The reason parameter
 * indicates the reason for the disconnection if the disconnection was
 * successful. If the disconnection was not successful, the value of the reason
 * parameter shall be ignored by the Host.
 * Note: if the connection is terminated by the remote device, the reason
 * parameter of this event is set to the reason specified by the remote device
 * only if it has an allowed value, otherwise the reason is forced to Remote
 * User Terminated Connection error code (0x13). Allowed remote reason values
 * are: Authentication Failure error code (0x05), Other End Terminated
 * Connection error codes (0x13 to 0x15), Unsupported Remote Feature error code
 * (0x1A), and Unacceptable Connection Parameters error code (0x3B).
 * See Bluetooth spec. v.5.4 [Vol 4, Part E, 7.7.5].

 * role switch, for example.
 * The meaning of the Encryption_Enabled parameter depends on whether the Host
 * has indicated support for Secure Connections in the
 * Secure_Connections_Host_Support parameter. When
 * Secure_Connections_Host_Support is 'disabled' or the Connection_Handle
 * refers to an LE link, the Controller shall only use Encryption_Enabled
