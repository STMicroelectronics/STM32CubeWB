 * parameter shall be ignored by the Host.

 * parameter of this event is set to the reason specified by the remote device
 * only if it has an allowed value, otherwise the reason is forced to Remote
 * User Terminated Connection error code (0x13). Allowed remote reason values
 * are: Authentication Failure error code (0x05), Other End Terminated
 * Connection error codes (0x13 to 0x15), Unsupported Remote Feature error code
 * (0x1A), and Unacceptable Connection Parameters error code (0x3B).

 * has indicated support for Secure Connections in the
 * Secure_Connections_Host_Support parameter. When
