 * on or off.
 * The Host_ACL_Data_Packet_Length command parameter will be used to determine
 * the size of the L2CAP segments contained in ACL Data Packets, which are
 * transferred from the Controller to the Host.
 * The Host_Synchronous_Data_Packet_Length command parameter is used to
 * determine the maximum size of HCI synchronous Data Packets. Both the Host
 * and the Controller shall support command and event packets, where the data
 * portion (excluding header) contained in the packets is 255 octets in size.
 * The Host_Total_Num_ACL_Data_Packets command parameter contains the total
 * number of HCI ACL Data Packets that can be stored in the data buffers of the
 * Host. The Controller will determine how the buffers are to be divided
 * between different Connection_Handles.
 * The Host_Total_Num_Synchronous_Data_Packets command parameter gives the same
