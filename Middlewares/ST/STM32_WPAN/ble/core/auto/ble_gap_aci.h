/**
 * @brief ACI_GAP_SET_LIMITED_DISCOVERABLE
 * Puts the device in limited discoverable mode (as defined in Core
 * Specification [Vol 3, Part C, 9.2.3]). The device will be discoverable for
 * maximum period of TGAP (lim_adv_timeout) = 180 seconds (from errata). The
 * advertising can be disabled at any time by issuing
 * ACI_GAP_SET_NON_DISCOVERABLE command.
 * The Adv_Interval_Min and Adv_Interval_Max parameters are optional. If both
 * are set to 0, the GAP will use default values for adv intervals for limited
 * discoverable mode (250 ms and 500 ms respectively).
 * To allow a fast connection, the host can set Local_Name, Service_Uuid_List,
 * Conn_Interval_Min and Conn_Interval_Max. If provided, these data will be
 * inserted into the advertising packet payload as AD data. These parameters
 * are optional in this command. These values can be set in advertised data
 * using ACI_GAP_UPDATE_ADV_DATA command separately.
 * The total size of data in advertising packet cannot exceed 31 bytes.
 * With this command, the BLE Stack will also add automatically the following
 * standard AD types:
 * - AD Flags
 * - Power Level
 * When advertising timeout happens (i.e. limited discovery period has
 * elapsed), controller generates ACI_GAP_LIMITED_DISCOVERABLE_EVENT event.
 * Note: this command only supports legacy advertising For extended
 * advertising, refer to ACI_GAP_ADV_SET_CONFIGURATION and
 * ACI_GAP_ADV_SET_ENABLE..

/**
 * @brief ACI_GAP_START_GENERAL_CONNECTION_ESTABLISH_PROC
 * Starts a general connection establishment procedure. The host enables
 * scanning in the controller with the scanner filter policy set to "accept all
 * advertising packets" and from the scanning results, all the devices are sent
 * to the upper layer by the event HCI_LE_ADVERTISING_REPORT_EVENT (or by the
 * event HCI_LE_EXTENDED_ADVERTISING_REPORT_EVENT when the extended advertising
 * feature is supported). The upper layer then has to select one of the devices
 * to which it wants to connect by issuing the command
 * ACI_GAP_CREATE_CONNECTION. If privacy is enabled, then either a private
 * resolvable address or a non-resolvable address, based on the address type
 * specified in the command is set as the scanner address but the gap create
 * connection always uses a private resolvable address if the general
 * connection establishment procedure is active.
 * Before the call to ACI_GAP_CREATE_CONNECTION, the procedure can be
 * terminated by issuing the command ACI_GAP_TERMINATE_GAP_PROC with the
 * procedure code set to 0x10.
 * After the call to ACI_GAP_CREATE_CONNECTION, the procedure is terminated
 * when a connection is established, or the upper layer terminates the
 * procedure by issuing the command ACI_GAP_TERMINATE_GAP_PROC with the
 * procedure code set to 0x40. On completion of the procedure a
 * ACI_GAP_PROC_COMPLETE_EVENT event is generated with the procedure code set
 * to 0x40.
 * If privacy is enabled and the peer device (advertiser) is in the resolving
 * list then the link layer generates a RPA.
 * 
 * @param LE_Scan_Type Passive or active scanning. With passive scanning, no
 *        scan request PDUs are sent.

 * @param Scanning_Filter_Policy The scanning filter policy determines how the
 *        scanner's Link Layer processes advertising and scan response PDUs.
 *        There is a choice of two primary filter policies: unfiltered and

 *        Unfiltered: the Link Layer processes all advertising and scan
