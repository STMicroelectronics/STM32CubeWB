/**
 * @brief ACI_GAP_SET_LIMITED_DISCOVERABLE
 * Puts the device in limited discoverable mode (as defined in Bluetooth spec.
 * v.5.4 [Vol 3, Part C, 9.2.3]). The device will be discoverable for maximum
 * period of TGAP (lim_adv_timeout) = 180 seconds (from errata). The
 * advertising can be disabled at any time by issuing
 * ACI_GAP_SET_NON_DISCOVERABLE command.
 * The Adv_Interval_Min and Adv_Interval_Max parameters are optional. If both
 * are set to 0, the GAP will use default values for adv intervals for limited
 * discoverable mode (250 ms and 500 ms respectively).
 * To allow a fast connection, the host can set Local_Name, Service_Uuid_List,
 * Conn_Interval_Min and Conn_Interval_Max. If provided, these data will be
 * inserted into the advertising packet payload as AD data. These parameters
 * are optional in this command. These values can be set in advertised data
 * using ACI_GAP_UPDATE_ADV_DATA command separately.
 * The total size of data in advertising packet cannot exceed 31 bytes.
 * With this command, the BLE Stack will also add automatically the following
 * standard AD types:
 * - AD Flags
 * - Power Level
 * When advertising timeout happens (i.e. limited discovery period has
 * elapsed), controller generates ACI_GAP_LIMITED_DISCOVERABLE_EVENT event.
 * Note: this command only supports legacy advertising.

 * ACI_GAP_TERMINATE_GAP_PROC with the procedure code set to 0x10. On
 * completion of the procedure a ACI_GAP_PROC_COMPLETE_EVENT event is generated
 * with the procedure code set to 0x10.
