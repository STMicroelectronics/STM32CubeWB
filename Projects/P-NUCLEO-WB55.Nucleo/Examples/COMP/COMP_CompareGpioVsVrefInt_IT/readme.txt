@par Example Description 

How to configure the COMP peripheral to compare the external
voltage applied on a specific pin with the Internal Voltage Reference. 

At the beginning of the main program the HAL_Init() function is called to reset 
all the peripherals, initialize the Flash interface and the systick.

The SystemClock_Config() function is used to configure the system clock for STM32WB55RGVx  Devices

When the comparator input crosses (either rising or falling edges) the internal 
reference voltage VREFINT (1.22V), the comparator generates an interrupt
and exit from STOP mode.

The System enters STOP mode 5 seconds after the comparator is started and 
after any system wake-up triggered by the comparator interrupt.

In this example, the comparator input is connected on the pin PA1 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32).
The user shall apply a voltage on and each time the comparator input crosses VREFINT, MCU is awake,
system clock is reconfigured and LED2 is ON.

If LED3 is toggling continuously without any voltage update, it indicates that the system 
generated an error.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides 
      accurate delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. 
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then 
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than the 
      peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked. 
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set 
      to 1 millisecond to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment 

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices.

  - This example has been tested with P-NUCLEO-WB55 board and can be
    easily tailored to any other supported device and development board.

  - Apply an external variable voltage on PA1 (Arduino connector CN8 pin A2, Morpho connector CN7 pin 32) with average voltage 1.22V.
