@par Example Description

How to use an ADC peripheral to perform a single ADC conversion on the 
internal temperature sensor and calculate the temperature in degrees Celsius. 
This example uses the polling programming model (for interrupt or DMA 
programming models, refer to other examples).
This example is based on the STM32WBxx ADC LL API.
The peripheral initialization is done using LL unitary service functions 
for optimization purposes (performance and size).

Example configuration:
ADC is configured to convert a single channel, in single conversion mode,
from SW trigger.
Sequencer of group regular (default group available on ADC of all STM32 devices)
is configured to convert 1 channel: internal channel temperature sensor.

Example execution:
At each press on User push-button (SW1), the ADC performs 1 conversion of the selected channel.
Software polls for conversion completion.
When conversion is completed, main program reads conversion data
from ADC data register and stores it into a variable, LED2 is turned on.

ADC conversions raw data are computed to physical values
using LL ADC driver helper macro:
 - Value of temperature (unit: degree Celsius)

For debug: variables to monitor with debugger watch window:
 - "uhADCxConvertedData": ADC group regular conversion data
 - "hADCxConvertedData_Temperature_DegreeCelsius": Value of temperature (unit: degree Celsius)

LED2 is blinking every 1 sec in case of error. 

Connection needed:
None.

Other peripherals used:
  1 GPIO for User push-button (SW1)
  1 GPIO for LED2
