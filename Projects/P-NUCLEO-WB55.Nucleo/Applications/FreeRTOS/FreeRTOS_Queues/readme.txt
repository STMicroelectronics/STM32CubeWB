@par Application Description

How to use message queues with CMSIS RTOS API.

This application creates two threads that send and receive an incrementing number 
to/from a queue, as following:
One thread acts as a producer and the other as the consumer. The consumer 
is a higher priority than the producer and is set to block on queue reads. 
The queue only has space for one item, as soon as the producer posts a
message on the queue (every 1 second) the consumer will unblock, preempt
the producer, and remove the item.  

Add the following variables to LiveWatch, these variables must remain equals all the time:
 - ProducerValue
 - ConsumerValue

P-NUCLEO-WB55's LEDs can be used to monitor the application status:
  - LED2 should toggle as soon as the producer posts a
    message on the queue (every 1 second).
  - LED3 should toggle each time any error occurs.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in HAL time base ISR.
      This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the HAL time base interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower) than
      the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the HAL time base interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority()
      function.
 
@note The application needs to ensure that the HAL time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@note The FreeRTOS heap size configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h is set accordingly to the 
      OS resources memory requirements of the application with +10% margin and rounded to the upper Kbyte boundary.
