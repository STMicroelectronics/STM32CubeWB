@par Application Description 

How to use OnOff cluster on a Centralized Zigbee network with device acting as coordinator.

The purpose of this application is to show how to create a centralized Zigbee network, and how to communicate
from one node to another one using the OnOff cluster. Once the Zigbee mesh network is created, the 
user can send requests to the different boards through the push buttons in order to make the LED toggling.

Each device acts as a client and a server at the same time, making the communication between the different 
boards symmetrical (bi-directorial)

This application requires at minimum two STM32WB55xx nucleo boards, but you can use up four boards. 

This application requests having the stm32wb5x_zigbee_full_fw.bin binary flashed on the wireless coprocessor 
and the correct binary flashed on the application processor.

Important note :
================ 
As it is a centralized network, to run this application, you need to have one device acting 
as coordinator and all the others devices acting as routers.

One board must be flashed with the binary generated by this application (Zigbee/Zigbee_OnOff_Coord)
The other boards must be flashed with the binary generated by the application named (Zigbee/Zigbee_OnOff_Router)

To run the application :

  a)  Once the boards have been flashed, eboot the different devices one by one. 
      There must be on board configured in coordinator mode , and all 
      other boards should be configured in router mode.

  b)  Wait for a few seconds (around 5 sec), it order to let the zigbee mesh network being created. 
        
  c)  At this stage, a Zigbee network is automatically created and it is possible to send OnOffCluster commands 
      in multicast mode by pressing on the SW1 or SW2 push button. 
      Press on SW1 (resp SW2) . You must see the LED1 (resp LED2) toggling  on all board connected to this newly created 
      Zigbee network.

@par Hardware and Software environment

  - This example runs on STM32WB55xx devices (Nucleo board) 
  
  - This example has been tested with an STMicroelectronics STM32WB55RG_Nucleo 
    board and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.
    
  - On STM32WB55RG_Nucleo, the jumpers must be configured as described
    in this section. Starting from the top left position up to the bottom 
    right position, the jumpers on the Board must be set as follows: 

     CN11:    GND         [OFF]
     JP4:     VDDRF       [ON]
     JP6:     VC0         [ON]
     JP2:     +3V3        [ON] 
     JP1:     USB_STL     [ON]   All others [OFF]
     CN12:    GND         [OFF]
     CN7:     <All>       [OFF]
     JP3:     VDD_MCU     [ON]
     JP5:     GND         [OFF]  All others [ON]
     CN10:    <All>       [OFF]


@par How to use it ? 

=> Loading of the stm32wb5x_zigbee_full_fw.bin binary

  This application requests having the stm32wb5x_zigbee_full_fw.bin binary flashed on the Wireless Coprocessor.
  If it is not the case, you need to use STM32CubeProgrammer to load the appropriate binary.
  All available binaries are located under /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries directory.
  Refer to UM2237 to learn how to use/install STM32CubeProgrammer.
  Refer to /Projects/STM32_Copro_Wireless_Binaries/ReleaseNote.html for the detailed procedure to change the
  Wireless Coprocessor binary. 

=> Getting traces
  To get the traces you need to connect your Board to the Hyperterminal (through the STLink Virtual COM Port).
  The UART must be configured as follows:

    - BaudRate = 115200 baud  
    - Word Length = 8 Bits 
    - Stop Bit = 1 bit
    - Parity = none
    - Flow control = none

=> Running the application

  Refer to the Application description at the beginning of this readme.txt
