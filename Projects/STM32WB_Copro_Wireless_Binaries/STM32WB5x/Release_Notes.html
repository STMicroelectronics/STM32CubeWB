<li>Latest version of the FUS to upgrade board containing only FUS v0.5.3</li>
</ul></li>
<li>stm32wb5x_FUS_fw.bin
<ul>
<li>Firmware Upgrade Services (FUS)</li>
<li>This binary is the utility to flash the Wireless Coprocessor Binaries.</li>
<li>Latest version of the FUS</li>
</ul></li>
<li>stm32wb5x_Safeboot_fw.bin
<ul>
<li>This Safeboot binary provides only optional security enhancements. It can be installed on STM32WB devices where FUS V1.1.0 or FUS V1.1.1 is present. No need to use it on parts where FUS V1.2.0 is present (as these parts already have the latest Safeboot version).</li>
<li>When Safeboot update is performed, a factory reset of the device will be done, so FUS_UFB_CORRUPT message will be displayed which means that the Safeboot upgrade was correctly done and the device is back to factory state. If you reset the device and ping again for FUS state you have FUS_NO_ERROR message.</li>
<li>Safeboot is an independent part of the FUS that manages specifically one case: the option bytes corruption:
<ul>
<li>When option bytes are corrupted, the STM32WB hardware forces the boot to safeboot whatever the running firmware.</li>
<li>The Safeboot performs a factory reset (on FUS versions V1.1.0 and higher) which means the wireless stack is removed if any and the Cortex®-M4 code is erased and boot is reset to FUS (virgin part state).</li>
<li>This operation is also not reversible. In order to activate the Safeboot, the user must activate Cortex®-M0+ by writing the value 0x00008000 at the address 0x5800040C using the SWD interface.</li>
<li>Please note that if a part has FUS version strictly lower than V1.1.0 and gets option bytes corruption case, then, no recovery is possible.</li>

<div>
<h2 id="main-changes-11">Main Changes</h2>
<p><strong>Associated changes in Wireless Coprocessor Binary</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introducing following new binaries:
<ul>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_HCI_AdvScan_fw.bin</strong> : Ability to do advertising and scanning through HCI interface, <br/> Any connection can’t be done, numOfLinks can be set to 1 at the stack initialization call</li>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_LLD_fw.bin</strong> : LLD BLE Radio Transparent firmware</li>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_Thread_dynamic_fw.bin</strong> : BLE Thread Dynamic concurrent mode</li>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_Zigbee_FFD_dynamic_fw.bin</strong> : BLE Zigbee Full Function Device Dynamic concurrent mode</li>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_Zigbee_RFD_dynamic_fw.bin</strong> : BLE Zigbee Reduced Function Device Dynamic concurrent mode</li>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_phy802_15_4_fw.bin</strong> replaces stm32wb5x_rfmonitor_phy802_15_4_fw.bin</li>
</ul></li>
<li>BLE Zigbee static mode is now split in two binaries:
<ul>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_Zigbee_FFD_static_fw.bin</strong> : BLE Zigbee Full Function Device Static concurrent mode
<ul>
<li>When using this static concurrent mode, the application can switch from BLE to Zigbee_FFD or from Zigbee_FFD to BLE on request. When in Zigbee mode, the device is acting as a Full Function Device</li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>stm32wb5x_BLE_Zigbee_RFD_static_fw.bin</strong> : BLE Zigbee Reduced Function Device Static concurrent mode
<ul>
<li>When using this static concurrent mode, the application can switch from BLE to Zigbee_RFD or from Zigbee_RFD to BLE on request. When in Zigbee mode, the device is acting as a Reduced Function Device (End device or Sleepy End Device only)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li>BLE:
<ul>
<li>ID 84973 : ACI_GAP_SET_DIRECT_CONNECTABLE command works for Directed_Advertising_Type in Low Duty Cycle Directed Advertising (0x01) <br/> only when Advertising_Interval_Min and Advertising_Interval_Max correctly set to 3.75 ms</li>
<li>ID 86883 : remove NVM relative code and constants from M0 firmware regenerated binaries for HCI Layer only <br/> and beacon only (BLE_HCILayer_fw,BLE_HCI_AdvScan_fw)</li>
<li>ID 86884 : remove const qualifier of NVM RAM emulation buffer in M0 firmware binaries to get in RAM not in ROM</li>
<li>ID 89110 : ACI_HAL_SCAN_REQ_REPORT_EVENT routine optimized in M0 firmware regenerated binaries as it was writing <br/> more data in memory than the allowed event size</li>
<li>ID 89430 : Integrate auto-generated DTM_cmd_db_xxx module in BLE stack libraries</li>
<li>ID 89456 : ERR_BLE_INIT event is enum listed, kept but not really supported as not reported</li>
<li>ID 90095 : Device Privacy Mode is now mandatory for BLE 5.0 and implemented to handle command HCI_LE_SET_PRIVACY_MODE command</li>
<li>ID 90607 : Beacon Only certification needs LE Test commands and LE Read Buffer Size command as: <br/> HCI_LE_RECEIVER_TEST, HCI_LE_TEST_END,HCI_LE_TRANSMITTER_TEST and LE_READ_BUFFER_SIZE integrated commands</li>
<li>ID 90891 : DEEPSLEEP mode on CPU2 not applied after aci_hal_stack_reset or hci_reset command is executed. <br/> A fix is to enable back the Stop Mode when the hci_reset() command is executed, included in all regenerated M0 firmware binaries</li>
<li>ID 91134 : SHCI_SUB_EVT_BLE_NVM_RAM_UPDATE not implemented on the stack side. <br/> A fix has been implemented on CPU2 to receive expected events on CPU1</li>
<li>ID 91157 : FLASH_SR_EOP flag remains set after the bonding info stored in NVM. <br/> A fix has been implemented to clear EOP flag after flash processing on CPU2</li>
<li>ID 91309 : A bug identified in the Link Layer which not de-allocate the memory it has allocated for ACL packets <br/> to be sent to the upper layer memory used for previous ACL packets. <br/> A fix implemented to de-allocate packet not yet sent to upper layers at the disconnection time<br />
</li>
<li>ID 91351 : CPU2 gets stuck when EOP and EOPIE both set in CPU1 FLASH interface prior CPU2 booting. <br/> A fix in NVM arbiter implemented as enable SYSCFG only when EOPIE is enabled</li>
<li>ID 92458 : Replace the EOP polling by CFGBSY polling in CPU2 M0 firmware to get confirmation flash operation is completed <br/> to avoid unexpected interrupt on CPU1 side when its EOPIE bit is set</li>
<li>ID 91576 : The feature flag LE Power Class 1 shall be set when the ExtPa is used</li>
</ul></li>
<li>THREAD:
<ul>
<li>ID 91267 : Fix CoAP OpenThread API exposed on application side: <br/> The CoAP API is now compliant with OpenThread definition and mContext parameter is then correctly returned to the application.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ZIGBEE:
<ul>
<li>Storage of the APS binding table in RFD mode (Persistence data management).</li>
<li>Integration of the dynamic concurrent mode between BLE and Zigbee.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>MAC 802.15.4:
<ul>
<li>ID 85031 : Association Procedure occasionally fails between 2 STM32WBxx
<ul>
<li>802.15.4 LLD enhancement corrects this issue.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>ID 91900 : Unexpected received Association Response
<ul>
<li>Fix provided in MAC reset procedure that deeply reset the Radio and 802.15.4 IP.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
