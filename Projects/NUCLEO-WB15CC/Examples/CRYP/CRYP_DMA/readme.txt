@par Example Description

How to use the AES2 peripheral to encrypt and decrypt data using AES 128
Algorithm with ECB chaining mode in DMA mode.

DMA is used to transfer data from memory to the AES processor
input as well as to transfer data from AES processor output to memory.

64-byte buffers are ciphered and deciphered (4 AES blocks)
Ciphering/Deciphering with a 128-bit long key is used with data type set to 8-bit (byte swapping).

This example unrolls as follows:
- AES Encryption (Plain Data --> Encrypted Data)
- AES Decryption with key derivation (Encrypted Data --> Decrypted Data)

Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data are displayed on debugger terminal IO.
Note that when resorting to MDK-ARM KEIL IDE, plain data, encrypted data and decrypted
data are displayed on debugger as follows:  View --> Serial Viewer --> Debug (printf) Viewer.
When resorting to STM32CubeIDE:
Command Code is displayed on debugger as follows: Window--> Show View--> Console.
In Debug configuration :
- Window\Debugger, select the Debug probe : ST-LINK(OpenOCD)
- Window\Startup, add the command "monitor arm semihosting enable"

When all ciphering and deciphering operations are successful, LED2 is turned on.
In case of ciphering or deciphering issue, LED3 toggle each 200ms.

The Plain data, encrypted data and decrypted data can be displayed on a PC
HyperTerminal using the UART. USE_VCP_CONNECTION=1 must be added in command line.

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate
      delay (in milliseconds) based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This
      implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from a peripheral ISR process, then
      the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.

@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment

   - This example runs on STM32WB15CCUx devices.

    - This example has been tested with a STM32WB15CCUx embedded on an
    NUCLEO-WB15CC board and can be easily tailored to any other supported
    device and development board.


@par How to use it ?

In order to make the program work, you must do the following:
 - Open your preferred toolchain
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
